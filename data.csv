   Do not try watching the entire video at once. Limit your watch time from 30 or 60 minutes each day and make sure to participate and understand the code.

EDIT: It also helps if you take notes or take a picture of the final result of the lesson. It is very helpful to look at when you're away from your computer. If you forget, you have a chance to examine the code and see how and why things work.",1.1K,1 year ago (edited)

"2:12:21  If you wanna use remove(x) method instead of append(x), make sure you copy the list to another variable say list1.  Because if you use only the main list, it will shorten the list according to the remove(x) method, so python interpreter will jump a few numbers.  So some of the duplicates will remove and some of them will remain unremoved. 

So use the list variable to run the loop and make changes [ remove(x) ] in the variable list1

Here's my code : 

# removes the duplicates in a list
 
list = [5, 8, 5, 4, 7, 4, 7, 3, 1, 8, 100, 100, 5, 9]
list.sort()
print(numbers)
 
list1 = list.copy()             # caution:  can't use list1 = list
value = float('-inf')
 
for x in list:
    if value == x:
        list1.remove(x)

"for people starting out

don't worry if you watched 5 minutes of his video and ended up practicing for 60 minutes. That's actually the most practical way to learn. Here is how i learn :

I finish two topics and then i spend time practicing both of them together, then when i learn the next topic i practice all three topics together. That way i don't forget. Don't get frustrated just slow down relax and practice and before you know it you'll be done :)

Pro tips
: If you're watching in laptop watch in cinema mode [full screen] 
Open a google docs or a word document and write some code that. you find hard to understand and then learn it step by step.
Before starting to watch the video again, review the material and revise it before learning a new topic

i know you are the one who is teaching us here, but wouldnt it be simpler NOT to have that variable there?

here is what i wrote

weight = input(""Weight: "")
lbs_or_kg = input(""(L)bs or (K)g: "")
 
if lbs_or_kg.upper() == ""L"":
    print(f""You are {float(weight) * 0.45359290943} Kg"")
elif lbs_or_kg.upper() == ""K"":
    print(f""You are {float(weight) * 2.20462} Lbs"")
else:

"Thanks for the tutorial! I have a question: how come that the '=' does not always behave the same way? If I write: 
cell1 = list[0] 
cell2 = list[0]
cell1 and cell2 are independent, since the '=' only puts the value of the right expression into the variable on the left. So modifying cell1 will not modify cell2. And it will not modify list[0] either.

However, in the excel project (4:04:00), if I write:
cell1 = sheet.cell(1, 3)
cell2 = sheet.cell(1, 3)
cell1 and cell2 are actually dependent. The '=' is doing more that just putting the value of the right expression into the variable on the left. It is creating a link between its two sides. So if I modify the value of cell2, the value of  sheet.cell(1, 3) will be automatically modified, and cell1 will also be modified, even if the instruction 'cell1 = sheet.cell(1, 3)' was previously executed by the program and not executed again to update the value of cell1.
So why the '=' is having such a different behaviour? And what determines which behaviour it should have?

Thank you for such great Python content. I'm a beginner and had a question while making the second mini task ""name+color""

I would really appreciate it if you could help me with one question. The question is the following: Can we add an input (color=input(""What's your favorite color? "") command inside the print parentheses?

name = input('What is your name? ')
print('Nice to meet you ' + name + "". What's your favorite color? "")

or it only has to be typed line by line:

name = input('What is your name? ')
print('Nice to meet you ' + name)
color = input(""What's your favorite color? "")

print(name + "" likes the "" + color + "" color :)"")

"Hi Mosh.
Please can you help me with question.
It's really difficult for me. 

Given the final percentage a student has gotten at the end of a semester, you need to write a program that decides if the student has passed or failed the semester.

If the percentage is higher than or equal to 60, the student has passed the semester. If the percentage is lower than 60, the student has failed the semester.

However, the percentage is not the only thing that determines if a student has passed or failed. A student does not pass if their score is 5 points below the class average.

For instance, if the average class score is 70, the student must have a minimum score of 65 to pass.

If the average class score is 50, the student still needs a score of 60 to pass based on our first condition.",0,3 weeks ago

 (I am not so good at English, so pardon me of my grammer mistakes) I am following your 6 hour python course beginners since last week. I am so grateful that I found you. Your teaching is amazing. And you are giving problems to workout on frequent intervals(I like that).
So about myself, I am a Bsc Computer Science student in India, Kerala. My love for programming made me to took that course. But I am so confused that why these universities are bringing maths into this course. I know maths is necessary. But I am studying too much calculas here. Because of these I am not able to study computer science subjects. But when I found your channel, I felt that this is the better place for me to study programming rather than my college.
       So summing up I was saying that my passion and interest for programming has increased after meeting you. I am into programming not for money, I just love programming. But, still I have no idea about what my future job could be. But I am sure that it will something that depend on coding. And Mosh, you will always have a space in my heart for your hardwork.

"It is interesting that the method find for String returns -1 when it cannot find the character that you are looking for.
However, then you can use index position -1 in a String to find a character.
Therefore you cannot directly use the result from find to retrieve the character at an index position.
But -1 is the position of the last character of the string...

I am aware that ""find"" is a method, but Python allows position -1. Even when this is right, I find that for a string this is a bit inconsistent :)",0,1 month ago
